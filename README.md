After attending a recent town hall at 42 you came to the disturbing realization that you never learned how to properly handle alcoholic beverages. Ashamed at your inability to even distinguish between high and low quality wines you’ve decided to learn how to properly appraise and handle your drinks (assuming you‘re over the legal age limit of course!).

Not even knowing where to begin, you decide to enlist the help of Marvin to tackle this diﬂicult problem! With some prodding. Marvin grudgingly provides a detailed Chemical analysis and quality score for a number of wines. However, he remarks "It‘s pointless, even if you used all the neurons in that tiny brain of yours. But you won’t listen will you? No one ever does..." 

Wanting to prove Marvin Wrong, you decide to show him that you can learn how to distinguish high quality wines from bad ones with just one neuron! Try as you might though you can’t seem to focus the attention of one of your neurons on the task. You recently just started studying machine learning though and vaguely recall that a perceptron might be a reasonable substitute for your clearly nonecooperative neurons!

### Your goal for this project is to use perceptrons to distinguish between high and low quality wines and prove Marvin Wrong!

Marvin has grudginglv provided a detailed chemical analysis on a number of red and white wines (winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv). At the top of each dataset, he`s listed the parameters he`s analyzed. Those parameters include:
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality

Marvin has also included a “Quality" parameter which is his simulation of the score that three trained wine testers would give the wine.
